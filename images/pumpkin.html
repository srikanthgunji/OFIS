<h3>The above fertiliser is best for pumpkin</h3>
<h3>it’s suited for all kinds of edible plants such as pumpkins, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables. As the name suggests, it comes in granules form and has an NPK of 7-6-9, making it great for the pumpkin growth and fruiting stages.

With the number of granules provided in the container, you can fertilize 220 square feet of land. You’ll see changes in foliage size within a short time of application. Reapply the fertilizer every 4-6 weeks for effectiveness.

Miracle-Gro uses soybean meal, feather meal, nitrate of soda, sunflower hull ash, bone meal, phosphate rock, and sulfate of potash to make this fertilizer. It doesn’t burn your plants as it slowly releases the formula.</h3></td>
