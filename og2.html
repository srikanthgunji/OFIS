            <p>Biofertilizers provide "eco-friendly" organic agro-input. Biofertilizers such as Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirilium and blue green algae (BGA) have been in use a long time. Rhizobium inoculant is used for leguminous crops. Azotobacter can be used with crops like wheat, maize, mustard, cotton, potato and other vegetable crops. Azospirillum inoculations are recommended mainly for sorghum, millets, maize, sugarcane and wheat. Blue green algae belonging to a general cyanobacteria genus, Nostoc or Anabaena or Tolypothrix or Aulosira, fix atmospheric nitrogen and are used as inoculations for paddy crop grown both under upland and low-land conditions. Anabaena in association with water fern Azolla contributes nitrogen up to 60 kg/ha/season and also enriches soils with organic matter.[2][3] Seaweeds are rich in various types of mineral elements (potassium, phosphorus, trace elements etc) hence they are extensively used as manure by people of coastal districts. Seaweed - manure also helps in breaking down clays. Fucus is used by Irish people as manure on a large scale. In tropical countries bottom mud of dried up ponds which contain abundant blue green algae is regularly used as manure in fields. The mixture of seaweeds and blue green algae may serve as ideal fertilizer.</p>

<li><a >Rhizobium : The effectiveness of symbiotic N2 fixing bacteria viz. Rhizobia for legume crops eg. Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Azorhizobium, and Mesorhizobium etc have been well recognized. These bacteria infecting legumes have a global distribution. These rhizobia have a N2-fixing capability up to 450 kg N ha–1 depending on host- plant species and bacterial strains. Carrier based inoculants can be coated on seeds for the introduction of bacterial strains into soil.  </a></li>

<li><a >Azotobacter: N2 fixing free-living bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen in cereal crops without any symbiosis. Such free living bacterias are: Azotobacter sp. for different cereal crops; Acetobacter diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum spp. for sugarcane, sorghum and maize crop. Beside fixing nitrogen, they also increase germination and vigour in young plants leading to an improved crop stand. They can fix 15-20 kg/ha nitrogen per year. Azotobacter sp. also has ability to produce anti fungal compounds against many plant pathogens. Azotobacter can biologically control the nematode diseases of plants also. </a></li>

<li><a >Azospirillum: The genus Azospirillum colonizes in a variety of annual and perennial plants. Studies indicate that Azospirillum can increase the growth of crops like sunflower, carrot, oak, sugarbeet, tomato, pepper, cotton, wheat and rice. The crop yield can increase from 5-30%. Inoculum of Azotobacter and Azospirillum can be produced and applied as in peat formulation through seed coating. The peat formulation can also be directly utilized in field applications.  </a></li>

                	<p>A biofertilizer is a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant.[1] Biofertilizers add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. The micro-organisms in biofertilizers restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of biofertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil. Biofertilizers can be expected to reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, but they are not yet able to replace their use. Since they play several roles, a preferred scientific term for such beneficial bacteria is "plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria" (PGPR).</p>

<p>OFIS encourages farmers to follow the principal of conservation agriculture in order to minimize soil disturbance, promoting intercropping and crop rotations and developing a permanent soil cover to minimize the need for chemical fertilizers.</p>

                <p>With the increase in population our compulsion would be not only to stabilize agricultural production. The scientists have realized that the ‘Green Revolution’ with high input use has reached a plateau and is now sustained with diminishing return of falling dividends. Thus, a natural balance needs to be maintained at all cost for existence of life and property. In this way OFRS is helping to contribute to meaningful socio-economic and ecologically sustainable development opportunities while improving the income and living conditions of farmers. Inputs commonly used in Organic Agriculture are:</p>

                

                
<li><a >Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria : Various bacteria that promote plant growth are collectively called plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). PGPR are thought to improve plant growth by colonizing the root system and pre empting the establishment of suppressing deleterious rhizosphere microorganisms on the roots. Large populations of bacteria established in planting material and roots become a partial sink for nutrients in the rhizosphere thus reducing the amount of C and N available to stimulate spores of fungal pathogens or for subsequent colonization of the root. PGPR belong to several genera viz.Actinoplanes, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Streptomyces, Xanthomonas etc. Bacillus spp. act as biocontrol agent because their endospores are tolerant to heat and desiccation. Seed treatment with B.subtilis is reported to increase yield of carrot by 48%, oats by 33% and groundnut upto 37%. </a></li>
<li><a >Phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB): Phosphorus is the vital nutrient next to nitrogen for plants and microorganisms. This element is necessary for the nodulation by Rhizobium and even to nitrogen fixers, Azolla and BGA. The phospho microorganism mainly bacteria and fungi make available insoluble phosphorus to the plants. It can increase crop yield up to 200-500 kg/ha and thus 30 to 50 kg Super Phosphate can be saved. Most predominant phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) belong to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas. At present PSB is most widely used biofertilizer in India. PSB can reduce the P requirement of crop up to 25%. </a></li>
<li><a >Mycorrhizal fungi: Root-colonizing mycorrhizal fungi increase tolerance of heavy metal contamination and drought. Mycorrhizal fungi improve soil quality also by having a direct influence on soil aggregation and therefore aeration and water dynamics. An interesting potential of this fungi is its ability to allow plant access to nutrient sources which are generally unavailable to the </a></li>
