<p>In organic farming, chemical herbicides cannot be used. So weeding can be done only manually. Different cultural practices like tillage, flooding, mulching can be used to manage the weeds. Besides, biological (pathogen) method can be used to manage the loss due to weeds. When the ground is fallow, a cover crop can be planted to suppress weeds and build soil quality. Weeds growth can also be limited by using drip irrigation whenever possible, which restricts the distribution of water to the plant line. </p>

<h4>MechanicalMethod</h4>
<p>Incorporating natural pest control measures into your growing scheme is a great start, but there are several man-made options at a grower’s disposal for keeping pests at bay. Mechanical & physical controls employ the use of physical objects or devices to control pests. These devices can include several different sizes, types and varieties of screens, barriers, fences, traps and mulches. This wide array of mechanisms can include deer fence, chicken wire, insect screens, bird nets, shade cloth, plastic mulch or other appropriate defense mechanisms to deter the infiltration of pests targeting your plants. Floating polyester row cover is a man-made product that provides defenses against several environmental stressors when properly utilized. The thin material allows rain water, sunlight, and gas exchange to permeate through to your crops, while preventing both the loss of heat and the infiltration of many insects and microbial pathogens. Physical controls may also involve the trapping and killing of pests around your growing areas. Garden stores provide an array of trapping options to include but not limited to sticky traps, colored traps, pheromone traps, trigger traps, light traps, and a variety of varmint traps designed to catch and/or kill small animals.<?p>

<h4>BiologicalMethod</h4>
<p>Biological controls employ methods for controlling pests using other organisms, and have very few drawbacks compared to chemicals. Species diversity amongst the landscape can provide many beneficial returns to our home ecosystem. Several predatory and beneficial insects are drawn to the home landscape when species abundance is prevalent. Fern-leaf yarrow (Achillea filipendulina) is an herbaceous perennial flower that is hardy to zones 3 to 9, and is a lovely addition to landscapes and borders of vegetable gardens. This crop is revered for its ability to attract several different species of predatory insects, to include Lacewings (Chrysopa spp.), Labybugs aka Ladybeetles (Hippodamia spp.), Hoverflies (Eupeodes spp.), and parasitic wasps to name a few. These predatory insects feed on, or lay eggs in, the insects that gorge on your plants, reducing their numbers exponentially. Preventative crops, such as the French and African varieties of marigolds (Tagetes spp.), secrete a root exudate into the soil that repels root feeding nematodes. The cultivar ‘Single Gold’ is sold as a highly effective preventative crop for this purpose.</p>
